description: "Follow FranCILDO's journey from skeptic to Ally in the Divergent Alliance."
---

My name is **FranCILDO**, I am 48 years old, a husband, a father, and I currently live in Fortaleza, Brazil. I enjoy nature, walking, running, and cycling. I have a background in **Systems Analysis and Development**, and my profession taught me to seek logic, structure, and method to understand the world. With this perspective, I decided to become an entrepreneur and created a business to boost the growth of small and medium-sized companies.

## Meeting the Permission Theory

Perhaps you are as skeptical as I was when I first encountered **Elton Euler's** work. Believe me, I understand you. If I said I joined the **Divergent Alliance** loving everything from the start, I would be lying.

My point of entry was through my wife. She started following Elton Euler and would tell me: _"You need to see this, it makes so much sense for you"_. Since my background is in Systems Analysis and Development and I learned to look for logic in everything, I resisted. I watched some videos, criticized several points, and even found some things "sad" or too heavy to face. I went to research this man and found some interesting things that reassured me.

## Academic Foundation and Credibility

One of the points that gave me confidence was Elton Euler's technical background. I saw that he is not one of those internet gurus; his work has academic recognition, having been awarded a **Doctor Honoris Causa at ABRASCI** (Brazilian Academy of Sciences, Arts, History, and Literature).

Furthermore, I share a world vision where men are challenged, women are valued, and children are protected.

Over time, I began to follow his work even more, and amidst the criticism, some keys started to turn; things began to make sense. One quote from Elton in particular moved me at a certain moment:

> Every material debt hides an emotional debt.

At that moment in my life, my finances and businesses were stagnant, and even though I had the capacity and willingness, things were not evolving.

## The Decision

Even while participating in some events, having insights, making some decisions, and taking action (the "famous PDA"), I still didn't have all the puzzle pieces I needed to move forward. That was when I decided to be part of this movement.

After the decision, I came across an important warning!
During the live streams, I noticed some reports of unofficial profiles trying to impersonate Divergent Alliance collaborators. Since I work in the **IT** field, I deal with **digital security** daily, and I saw how the Alliance acted quickly to implement secure processes for those interested in changing their history.

I filled out the interest form, talked to a collaborator, received my access, started my studies, and now I share my insights with you.
This blog is a record of how I apply the **Permission Theory** in both my business management and my personal life.
