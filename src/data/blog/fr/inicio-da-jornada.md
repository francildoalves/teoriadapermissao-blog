description: The first step in documenting my studies and experiences in the Divergent Alliance from the perspective of a Systems Analyst.
---

Welcome to my personal blog about the _Permission Theory_.

This space is born from a personal need to organize knowledge. As a _Systems Analyst_, I learned that documenting is a fundamental part of learning and the evolution of any project — including the project of our own lives.

## What will you find here?

Here, I am someone like you who investigates, critiques, and applies concepts, sharing the battlefield.
My goals with this blog are:

- **Document:** Register the application of the principles taught by Elton Euler.
- **Analyze:** Bring my point of view on _Permission Theory_.
- **Share:** Show how these concepts impact relationships, business management, and family harmony.
- **Inform:** About events and present safe options for those who want to delve deeper into the [method](https://indiquei.app/YKXGGVK).

## From Skeptic to Ally

As I mentioned on my [About Me](/about) page, I didn't join the _Divergent Alliance_ immediately "buying" the idea. I questioned, analyzed, and sought the logic behind the feelings.

There was a specific moment, a phrase that served as a turning point:

> Every material debt hides an emotional debt.

At that moment, I realized that the cold logic of numbers didn't explain everything. There was a hidden variable in the code of my life that I needed to decipher. The mysteries of the unconscious.

## Next Steps

From now on, I invite you to follow this continuous investigation into how our internal permissions shape our external reality.

I will bring content about:

1.  My perceptions applying the methodology;
2.  Analysis of day-to-day cases;
3.  Study summaries from the Alliance.

Feel free to explore and follow the upcoming updates.
